# Project Labyrinth

We started by fetching the data from the technigo API, there was a lot of trial and error before we settled for the approach we used on the project


## The problem

We went mobile first and used styled components, we learned a lot about APIS, styled components and as we moved along we tried a variety of 
different packages (some that we did not even use) and learned about them as well.
